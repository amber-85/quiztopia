Here is the link to my review and reflections of my code

The biggest thing I learned from this project is non-relationanl database is impossible to use join like sql database, we should design the database differently.
Secondly, the syntax is very different among different tech stacks. And typos are very hard to find out. Many errors were caused by these not by incorrect design of the code.
